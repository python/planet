# ADD FEED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I want to add my feed to the Python Planet.

## I checked the following required validations: (mark all 4 with [x])

1. [ ] My feed is valid, I checked using https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=MY_FEED_URL and it is valid!
2. [ ] My feed is a **Python Specific** feed, e.g: I am proposing the filtered tag or categorized feed url
3. [ ] I only post content to this feed which is related to the Python language and its components and libraries. Or content that I consider interesting for the Python community.
4. [ ] I am aware that once my feed is added it can take a few hours to start being fetched (according to the server update cycle)

Thanks in advance for adding my feed to the PythonPlanet! :+1:
