# The following provide defaults for each template:
# output_dir: Directory to place output files
# items_per_page: How many items to put on each page
# days_per_page: How many complete days of posts to put on each page
#                This is the absolute, hard limit (over the item limit)

# Any other section defines a feed to subscribe to.  The section title
# (in the []s) is the URI of the feed itself.  A section can also be
# have any of the following options:
# 
# name: Name of the feed (defaults to the title found in the feed)
# offset: Number of hours (+ or -) the feed's times tend to be out
#
# Additionally any other option placed here will be available in
# the template (prefixed with channel_ for the Items loop).  You can
# define defaults for these in a [DEFAULT] section, for example
# Planet Debian uses the following to define faces:
#
#     [DEFAULT]
#     facewidth = 64
#     faceheight = 64
#
#     [http://www.blog.com/rss]
#     face = foo.png
#     faceheight = 32
#
# The facewidth of the defined blog defaults to 64.
